 task brief : You are given two attachments: execute.py and data.xlsx.

- Commit execute.py after fixing the non-trivial error in it.
- Ensure it runs on Python 3.11+ with Pandas 2.3.
- Convert data.xlsx to data.csv and commit it.
- Add a GitHub Actions push workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml that:
  - Runs ruff and shows its results in the CI log
  - Runs: python execute.py > result.json
  - Publishes result.json via GitHub Pages
- Do not commit result.json; it must be generated in CI.
 task checks : ['execute.py, data.csv, and .github/workflows/ci.yml exist', 'result.json is NOT committed', 'execute.py does not contain the typo "revenew"', 'data.csv content equals data.xlsx (attachment)', 'CI YAML has steps for ruff, executing execute.py, and Pages deploy', 'GitHub Actions ran for this commit and logs show ruff + execute.py', 'result.json is published on GitHub Pages']
